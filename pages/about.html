            <h2>Hey...I'm Fraser</h2>
            <p>Hey, I’m Fraser McCarter, and I started building amps in the summer of 2025.  I first found I had an interest in repair work through guitars, taking on freelance jobs here and there after high school.  I have experience not just as a technician but also as a studio musician, having done studio work in and around East Lothian.  Now, having finished my Master of Arts in computer science and music, I wish to pursue something more creative.</p>
            <p>My first amp build started the same as many in the field, with a 5F1 Champ, but I wanted to prove myself.  I didn’t build from a kit or even parts from a handful of websites.  I sourced everything myself, either NOS or original ‘40s/’50s/’60s parts.  In the United States, there is an abundance of parts surrounding valve technology, especially suited for guitar amps, but in the UK, this is not the case.  It took a long time, though the results speak for themselves.  Below are some photos of this very amp.</p>

            <p>As a guitarist, I've always been fascinated with the unique value valve amps have in the world of guitar tone and sound.  With so many options nowadays for solid state amps, whether simulated or not, valve amps still hold a special place in the hearts of many musicians and I've fallen down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out why this is.</p>

            <h2>McCarter Amps</h2>
            <p>In late summer this year, I took a month-long furniture-making course at Chippendale School of Furniture.  Drawing on the skills learnt there, I’m now pursuing boutique amp building, with a focus on not only the sonics of the amp but also its looks.</p>
            <p>My goal with McCarter Amps is to deliver honest and beautiful hand-crafted amps, both in their sound and design.  Drawing from golden era amp technology and design philosophies from that period, I hope to provide something that is, in my eyes, unapologetically perfect.</p>
